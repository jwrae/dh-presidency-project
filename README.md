## Project Template

The goal of this Presidency Project is to analyize the words of the Office of the President through the State of the Union Addresses. We choose to include every President from Roosevelt to Trump in order to give us a solid baseline that leads into the modern era. These President's represent the leaders of the free world from the end of World War 2 to the dawning of the Information Age. In using their words to understand the Office, we hoped to gain a better understanding of how each President used their position to propagate information, what subjects they spoke about, their word usage, and any identifying and interesting marks which would surface through digital research.
We include every State of the Union Address from 1933 to 2018, which gives a solid base from which to analyze our contemporary leader. Using FDR to H.W. Bush as the background of 'normal presidential language', we then individually analyzed the speeches given by Clinton, Bush Jr, Obama, and Trump. In the case of Trump, we included each of his 'Weekly Addresses' to account for his lack of SoTU speeches. This gives us a solid foundation from which to run analysis and draw some cursory conclusions. Using comparisons between the baseline and the four most recent officeholders can give us some insight into how the office of the Presidency has change in focus, scope, and its message to the public.
