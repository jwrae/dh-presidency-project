Our main problems stem from the lack of ability to learn complex language analysis tools in such a short term project. While voyant-tools offers many ways to analyze and view word usage, it falls short of in-depth grammar, text, and sentiment analysis.

Given more time and more knowledge, we would have liked to include much more computational analysis of the text at hand. We would have also liked to include more data for the research, but stuck with the selected State of the Union's both for their public availability and time constraints. It would be possible to run full and complex language analysis on more documents of the office, and potentially the Tweets from Obama and Trump for a more personal analysis of their language during the terms that they served. This will be an ongoing learning experience and shall be updated with more whenever possible.
