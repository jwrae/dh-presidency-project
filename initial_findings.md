Our initial findings show some rather mundane observations about the speech of the presidency. The word usage and subjects correspond most obviously to immediate subjects at the time of the speech. During FDR and Truman's speeches we see references to autocracies, dictatorships, and subjects relating to the second world war. This is what one would expect when researching the topic. As the speeches progress through the decades, the subjects change slowly to Cold War & Soviet centered topics; They are mentioned more often, but the overall subject of the SoTU during these times were very much still focused on the United State's safety, economic prosperity and growth. Every president has speech writers working for them to develop and draft the speeches, so it is to be expected that the 'Language of the Office of the President' changes slowly and mostly attempts to broadcast the same tones. It is however, noticable when the decades give way to newer and more important subjects at hand.

One thing that is most interesting is changes during Bush Jr's administration. His first SoTU is lighthearted and full of jokes and anecdotes, while his second during the year 2002 following the 9/11/01 attacks is abrupt, stern, and short. His language and term usage remains steady along the baseline of presidential speech.
