We first used the website http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ to scrape the State of the Union Addresses from each President. Our tool was from webscraper.io.

After obtaining the raw text from the website, we manually split them into individual text files for each year in subsequent order from 1933 to the present day.

We separated the texts into categories of Roosevelt - H.W., Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump. These were to serve as the baseline, and four most recent President's analysis.

Using the site http://voyant-tools.org/ we were able to upload the text files as separate corpuses, (using the aformentioned categories) and use the tools available to analyze and provide small visualizations for the documents.

Unfortunately due to technical skill, ability, and time constraints, there was not other analysis tools available for raw text analytics for the term.

We then compiled our observations into summaries which describe the voyant visualizations.
